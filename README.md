A framework to built on top of MAVSDK which provides physical/virtual drone abstraction, abstraction for all async calls,
gives the end users an arduino-eqsue interface, and provides movement and utility methods based on relative coordinate systems.

---

## Requirements for Use
* python 3.8+
* PX4_Autopilot (either local or remote)
* mavsdk>=1.4.0
* numpy>=1.23.0
* pymavlink>=2.4.37
* grpcio>=1.47.0
* pyserial>=3.5
* Additional requirements needed for code in the implementations module

## Platform Compatibility

### Ubuntu (Most Supported)
   * **Supported for development and visual simulation**
   * Gazebo simulator (non-headless) requires Ubuntu 
   * PX4 has wider compatibility between Unix systems including Ubuntu

### Windows/WSL (Supported)
   * **Supported for development and visual simulation**
   * WSL Ubuntu 20.0.4 container
   * Gazebo simulator's window can be passed through
   * PX4 compatible

### macOS (Least Supported)
   * **Supported for development and *headless* simulation**
   * [PX4 Gazebo Headless](https://github.com/JonasVautherin/px4-gazebo-headless) Docker container allows for the running of the PX4 drone in the background.
   * Gazebo visualization in docker with X-server forwarding is possible, but not successfully reproduced yet.
