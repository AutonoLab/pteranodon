## Motivation
Autonomous drones are becoming more and more common in the world of technology, yet this technology is still out of reach for many. Those who want to create and use an autonomous drone are forced to “reinvent the wheel.” The Air Force Academy is looking for a way to bypass this to use autonomous drones for various tasks such as UAV drone discovery & intercept systems. By using our framework, these tasks would be more achievable for those without the knowledge needed for the creation and controlling of an autonomous drone.

## Description
A framework to built on top of MAVSDK which provides physical/virtual drone abstraction, abstraction for all async calls,
gives the end users an arduino-eqsue interface, and provides movement and utility methods based on relative cordinate systems.
